## Authentication

### HTTP Basic authentication

The API uses [HTTP Basic Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).
Note that this means that users with only an OpenID login cannot use the API; they have to add a
password to their account using the control panel on the site.

### OAuth authentication

OAuth 1.0a authentication for API resources is also supported. Generally, StatusNet's
UI and API are similar to Twitter's for OAuth applications (if you're new to OAuth
check out [Beginner’s Guide to OAuth](http://hueniverse.com/oauth/)).

To use OAuth, you'll need to register your client application via the web interface
and obtain a consumer key and secret. You can find the interface for application
registration at [http://%%site.server%%/%%site.path%%settings/oauthapps](http://%%site.server%%/%%site.path%%settings/oauthapps).

## JSONP callbacks

For API methods that return [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), an optional
JSONP-style callback parameter is supported. If supplied, the response will be in
JSONP format with a callback of the given name. To make it easier for clients to
handle error conditions, HTTP error codes are suppressed, and the errors will be
returned in the response body when using JSONP.

## Rate limiting

There is currently no rate-limiting.

## Gotchas

Some things to remember:

* %%site.name%% supports the
  [OStatus federation protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OStatus) (as well as
  [OpenMicroBlogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMicroBlogging) for backwards
  compatibility), so many notices and friends' profiles may come from other servers.
* User nicknames are unique, but they are not globally unique. Use the ID number
  instead.
* Private streams are not implemented yet.
* GNU social sites can be configured as private. In that case, all API methods
  require authentication, including the public timeline (see the 'config' method
  below).
* If "Fancy URLs" are not enabled, urls from above need to include "index.php" at
  the root. ( e.g. http://example.org/statusnet/api becomes http://www.example.org/statusnet/index.php/api )
* The `since_id` parameter does not work as documented by Twitter. Twitter says of
  `since_id`: "There are limits to the number of Tweets which can be accessed
  through the API. If the limit of Tweets has occured since the `since_id`, the
  `since_id` will be forced to the oldest ID available." However, GNU social will
  return the newest notices (or the newest back from max_id, if present)! Also, a
  `since_id` <= 0 will be ignored.

## Timeline resources

### statuses/public_timeline

Returns the 20 most recent notices, including repeats if they exist, from
non-protected users.

### statuses/home_timeline

Returns the 20 most recent notices, including repeats if they exist, posted by the
authenticating user and the users they follow. This is the same timeline seen by a
user when they login to their instance. This method is identical to
statuses/friends_timeline, except that this method always includes repeats.

### statuses/friends_timeline

Alias of statuses/home_timeline

### statuses/friends_timeline/:username

Alias of statuses/home_timeline for the specified username

### statuses/mentions

Returns the 20 most recent mentions (notices containing @username) for the
authenticating user.

This method will not include repeats in the XML and JSON responses unless the
include_rts parameter is set. The RSS and Atom responses will always include repeats
as notices prefixed with RT.

### statuses/replies

Alias of statuses/mentions

### statuses/replies/:username

Alias of statuses/mentions for the specified username

### statuses/user_timeline

Returns the 20 most recent notices posted by the authenticating user. It is also
possible to request another user's timeline by using the screen\_name or user_id
parameter. The other users timeline will only be visible if they are not protected,
or if the authenticating user's follow request was accepted by the protected user.

This method will not include repeats in the XML and JSON responses unless the
include_rts parameter is set. The RSS and Atom responses will always include
repeats as notices prefixed with RT, regardless of provided parameters.

## Friendships resources

### friendships/create

Allows the authenticating users to follow the user specified in the ID parameter.
Returns the befriended user in the requested format when successful. Returns a
string describing the failure condition when unsuccessful.

If you are already friends with the user a HTTP 403 may be returned, though for
performance reasons you may get a 200 OK message even if the friendship already
exists.

Note that users cannot subscribe to remote profiles using this API.

### friendships/destroy

Allows the authenticating users to unfollow the user specified in the ID parameter.
Returns the unfollowed user in the requested format when successful. Returns a
string describing the failure condition when unsuccessful.

Users can unsubscribe to a remote profile using this API, but it's preferred to use
numeric IDs to nicknames.

### friendships/exists

follows user_b, otherwise will return false. Authentication is required if either
user A or user B are protected. Additionally the authenticating user must be a
follower of the protected user.

### friendships/show

authentication was successful; returns a 401 status code and an error message if
not. Use this method to test if supplied user credentials are valid.

### account/end_session

Not implemented.

### account/update\_delivery_device

Not implemented.

### account/rate\_limit_status

the API limit is reached.

We have no rate limit, so this always returns 150 hits left.

### account/update\_profile\_background_image

Updates the authenticating user's profile background image. This method can also be
used to enable or disable the profile background image.

### account/update\_profile_image

Updates the authenticating user's profile image. Note that this method expects raw
multipart data, not a URL to an image.

Access Token. This method fulfills Section 6.3 of the OAuth 1.0 authentication flow.
The OAuth access token may also be used for xAuth operations.

## Search

The search method supports the following optional URL parameters:

* **callback**: if supplied when using the JSON format, the response will use the
  JSONP format with a callback of the given name.
* **rpp**: the number of notices to return per page, up to a max of 100.
* **page**: the page number (starting at 1) to return.
* **since_id:**: returns notices with ids greater than the given id.
