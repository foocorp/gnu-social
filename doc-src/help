%%site.name%% is a **social service**. Users can post short
(%%site.textlimit%% character) status messages which are broadcast to
their friends and colleagues on the service and (optionally) onto the Web.

You can also broadcast other types of data, like bookmarks, event
invitations, polls, and questions.

If you'd like to try it out, first [register](%%action.register%%) a new account.
Then, on the [public timeline](%%action.top%%), enter your message into
the textbox at the top of the page, and click "Send". It will go out on the
public timeline and to anyone who is subscribed to your notices.

To subscribe to other people's notifications, go to their profile page
and click the "subscribe" button. They'll get a notice that you're now
subscribed to their notifications.
