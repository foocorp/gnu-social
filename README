About
=====

StatusNet is a Free and Open Source social networking platform. It
helps people in a community, company or group to exchange short status
updates, do polls, announce events, or other social activities (and
you can add more!). Users can choose which people to "follow" and
receive only their friends' or colleagues' status messages. It
provides a similar service to sites like Twitter, Google+, Facebook or
Yammer, but is much more awesome.

With a little work, status messages can be sent to mobile phones,
instant messenger programs (GTalk/Jabber), and specially-designed
desktop clients that support the Twitter API.

StatusNet supports an open standard called OStatus
<http://ostatus.org/> that lets users in different networks follow
each other. It enables a distributed social network spread all across
the Web.

StatusNet was originally developed for the Open Software Service,
Identi.ca <http://identi.ca/>. It is shared with you in hope that you
too make an Open Software Service available to your users. To learn
more, please see the Open Software Service Definition 1.1:

    http://www.opendefinition.org/ossd

StatusNet, Inc. <http://status.net/> also offers this software as a
Web service, requiring no installation on your part. See
<http://status.net/signup> for details. The software run
on status.net is identical to the software available for download, so
you can move back and forth between a hosted version or a version
installed on your own servers.

A commercial software subscription is available from StatusNet Inc. It
includes 24-hour technical support and developer support. More
information at http://status.net/contact or email sales@status.net.

New this version
================

This is a security fix and bug fix release since 1.1.0,
released 2 July 2012. All 1.1.0 sites should upgrade to this version.

It includes the following changes:

- Fixes for SQL injection errors in profile lists.
- Improved ActivityStreams JSON representation of activities and objects.
- Upgrade to the Twitter 1.1 API.
- More robust handling of errors in distribution.
- Fix error in OStatus subscription for remote groups.
- Fix error in XMPP distribution.

A full changelog is available at http://status.net/wiki/StatusNet_1.1.1.

Troubleshooting
===============

The primary output for StatusNet is syslog, unless you configured a
separate logfile. This is probably the first place to look if you're
getting weird behaviour from StatusNet.

If you're tracking the unstable version of StatusNet in the git
repository (see below), and you get a compilation error ("unexpected
T_STRING") in the browser, check to see that you don't have any
conflicts in your code.

Unstable version
================

If you're adventurous or impatient, you may want to install the
development version of StatusNet. To get it, use the git version
control tool <http://git-scm.com/> like so:

    git clone git@gitorious.org:statusnet/mainline.git

This is the version of the software that runs on Identi.ca and the
status.net hosted service. Using it is a mixed bag. On the positive
side, it usually includes the latest security and bug fix patches. On
the downside, it may also include changes that require admin
intervention (like running a script or even raw SQL!) that may not be
documented yet. It may be a good idea to test this version before
installing it on your production machines.

To keep it up-to-date, use 'git pull'. Watch for conflicts!
