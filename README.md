project.

## About

GNU social is a free social networking
platform. It helps people in a community, company
or group to exchange short status updates, do
polls, announce events, or other social activities
(and you can add more!). Users can choose which
people to "follow" and receive only their friends'
or colleagues' status messages. It provides a
similar service to proprietary social network sites,
but is much more awesome.

With a little work, status messages can be sent to
mobile phones, instant messenger programs (using
XMPP), and specially-designed desktop clients that
support the Twitter API.

GNU social supports an open standard called
OStatus <https://www.w3.org/community/ostatus/> that lets users in
different networks follow each other. It enables a
distributed social network spread all across the
Web.

GNU social was originally developed as "StatusNet" by
StatusNet, Inc. with Evan Prodromou as lead developer.

It is shared with you in hope that you too make an
service available to your users. To learn more,
please see the Open Software Service Definition
1.1: <http://www.opendefinition.org/ossd>

## New this version

This is the development branch for the 1.2.x version of GNU social.
All daring 1.1.x admins should upgrade to this version.

So far it includes the following changes:

- Backing up a user's account is more and more complete.
- Emojis ðŸ˜¸ (utf8mb4 support)

The last release, 1.1.3, gave us these improvements:

- XSS security fix (thanks Simon Waters, <https://www.surevine.com/>)
- Many improvements to ease adoption of the Qvitter front-end <https://github.com/hannesmannerheim/qvitter>
- Protocol adaptions for improved performance and stability

Upgrades from _StatusNet_ 1.1.1 will also experience these improvements:

- Fixes for SQL injection errors in profile lists.
- Improved ActivityStreams JSON representation of activities and objects.
- Upgrade to the Twitter 1.1 API.
- More robust handling of errors in distribution.
- Fix error in OStatus subscription for remote groups.
- Fix error in XMPP distribution.
- Tracking of conversation URI metadata (more coherent convos)

### Troubleshooting

The primary output for GNU social is syslog,
unless you configured a separate logfile. This is
probably the first place to look if you're getting
weird behaviour from GNU social.

If you're tracking the unstable version of
GNU social in the git repository (see below), and you
get a compilation error ("unexpected T_STRING") in
the browser, check to see that you don't have any
conflicts in your code.

### Unstable version

If you're adventurous or impatient, you may want
to install the development version of GNU social.
To get it, use the git version control tool
<http://git-scm.com/> like so:

    git clone https://github.com/foocorp/gnu-social.git

In the current phase of development it is probably
recommended to use git as a means to stay up to date
with the source code. You can choose between these
branches:
- 1.2.x     "stable", few updates, well tested code
- master    "testing", more updates, usually working well
- nightly   "unstable", most updates, not always working

To keep it up-to-date, use 'git pull'. Watch for conflicts!
