The StoreRemoteMedia plugin downloads remotely attached files to local server.

Installation
============

to the bottom of your config.php

domain_whitelist array are accepted for local storage. When check_blacklist

that match a regex in the domain_whitelist and that match no regexen in the
domain_blacklist are accepted for local storage.
